when we init a repository, it install all git files to control versions
it have some differences: The staging area allow us to practice and create new code, the working directory is where I got the code and it could have tested code and the repository is where the code is stored.
Comparing the staging area with the most recent repository I could see the differences and ensure myself to make a commit
Branches are helpful when we need to implement new features and we don't know to include them into the master, when a team have some different ideas, they could implement them on different branches to obtain multiple versions
Diagrams helps me showing all branches and commits to locate how many and what could have
